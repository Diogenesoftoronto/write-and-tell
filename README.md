## About

Have you ever wanted to imporve your creative writing with some spontaneity and practice? Then this is the perfect app for you. Write&Tell is an app that lets you select random prompts from the subreddit r/writingprompts. Whether they be simple prompts, from an established universe, or just regular prompts, you can get any one you want. Soon you will be able to post response to prompts in the browser and maybe even the subreddit eventually. The idea is to eventually expand this to a timed game with the objective of being able to vote on the best prompts.
